rotating O piece crashes the bot 
all pieces after holding go too deep into the right wall and its unrotateable
left movement takes control over right movement, in tetrio last move takes over 

there is a thing that if you hold left or right, movement doesnt update until you PRESS the button, which is meh but doesnt change much since you wanna play slow while testing

while O piece is held, if you press L piece while holding right, and then old the O piece, the O piece will have weird bounds, allowing it to go to x = -1 and its maximum x will be 7, not allowing you to place the block on 3 places on the right ?????
basically pressing space while holding a key breaks stuff, for example hold down and press block, then change to I piece if you hold it and it can go to y=20 which is oob!!!!!?????

reason: piece is not being swapped correctyly, ghost piece updates, piece doesnt XD

pressing shift (upbutton) too many times crashes the game
