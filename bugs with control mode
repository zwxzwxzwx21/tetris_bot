there is a thing that if you hold left or right, movement doesnt update until you PRESS the button, which is meh but doesnt change much since you wanna play slow while testing

things to make control mode work like somewhat - normal tetris game
- left movement takes control over right movement, in tetrio last move takes over 
- ghost pieces are places where the bot thinks the best movement is, option is needed to disable calculating and make the botjust place pieces on y=1 x=4 without rotations, so that the player does the job
- ghost pieces can go into other pieces, becaues collition is only checked with walls, which makes softdrop kinda useless and awkward

idc about clutch clears or whatever
