rotating O piece crashes the bot 
all pieces after holding go too deep into the right wall and its unrotateable
left movement takes control over right movement, in tetrio last move takes over 

there is a thing that if you hold left or right, movement doesnt update until you PRESS the button, which is meh but doesnt change much since you wanna play slow while testing
